                            There was a dream and one day I could see it
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Like a bird in a cage I broke in

                        <p>
                            And demanded that somebody free it
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            And there was a kid with a head full of doubt
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So I'll scream 'til I die

                        <p>
                            And the last of those bad thoughts are finally out
                        </p>

                        This is one of my favorite lyrics by the Avett Brothers. It is from a song from their "I and Love and You" album called "Head Full of Doubt/Road Full of Promise." I like it a lot because it is a very hopeful line implying that we can build our own futures and make our dreams a reality.

                        I was first introduced to the Avett Brothers by my parents, so they are a very nostalgic band. Folk music in general also has that affect for me since my father has been in several bands over the years that all play folk rock music. This song in particular I remember listening to from a very young age, and it captures the poetic nature of a lot of the Avett Brothers' music. This song will always have a special place among the music I listen to.
